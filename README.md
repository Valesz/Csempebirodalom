# Csempebirodalom
This webpage is created for one of the courses in University of Szeged where we learn about modular development, and Angular.
Suprisingly I really got into the development of this project, and tried to learn more than the requirements.

## Technologies used for the project:
- HTML
- SCSS
- Typescript
- Angular

## Why is this the theme?
When I was scrolling through the available themes for the course I stumbled upon the tile webshop and found it really funny because who would develop a tile webshop so I set out to make it a relative good website with functionalities.
