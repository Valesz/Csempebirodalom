# Csempebirodalom
This webpage is created for one of the courses in University of Szeged where we learn about modular development, and Angular.
Suprisingly I really got into the development of this project, and tried to learn more than the requirements.

The website is deployed at the following address: <a href="https://csempebirodalom-11de9.web.app/main">https://csempebirodalom-11de9.web.app/main</a>

## Technologies used for the project:
- Angular
- Typescript
- HTML
- SCSS
- Firebase

## Why is this the theme?
When I was scrolling through the available themes for the course I stumbled upon the tile webshop and found it really funny because who would develop a tile webshop so I set out to make it a relative good website with functionalities.
